PROJECT NAME:
Branding Package Generator

GOAL:
Generate professional brand starter packages from a single high level input. The tool asks for an industry and optional business context to guide generation. The business context fields are for internal reference only and must not influence the algorithmic output unless explicitly enabled. The app returns color palette options plus exportable assets and a lightweight brand sheet.

PRIMARY USER:
Internal operator at Sandhills Geeks creating fast brand starters for clients.

NON GOALS:
No public user accounts. No payments. No external API dependency required for the core palette logic.

TECH STACK OPTIONS:
Option A PHP 8 plus Slim or Laravel minimal routes plus Twig or plain PHP views
Option B JavaScript Node 20 plus Express for API plus Vite plus React for UI
Either option must ship as a single self contained app that can be hosted on a basic VPS

ACCESSIBILITY AND QUALITY BAR:
All generated palettes must satisfy WCAG 2.2 contrast for primary text over background and for button text on primary and accent
Include color blindness simulation checks via matrix transforms and ensure at least one accessible pairing per palette
Deterministic output when a seed is provided so results can be reproduced

CORE INPUTS UI:
Field Industry single line text with autocomplete from a curated industry list
Field Brand Tone optional select conservative modern playful premium eco friendly trustworthy energetic minimal artisan techie healthcare finance hospitality education construction legal non profit restaurant retail beauty fitness automotive real estate
Field Business Name optional text
Field Tagline optional text
Field Values optional textarea comma separated words
Field Audience optional textarea
Field Competitors optional textarea URLs or names
Field Notes optional long textarea
Field Random Seed optional numeric. Same seed plus same industry must return same palettes
Field Theme Preference optional select light first dark first neutral first
Toggle Use Business Context in Generation default Off. When Off the algorithm must ignore business text fields for outputs

IMPORTANT RULE:
When Use Business Context in Generation is Off only Industry plus optional Brand Tone plus Theme Preference plus Seed may affect outputs

OUTPUTS:
Three palette options returned in one response. Each palette has
Name auto generated like Coastal Modern or Steelworks Professional
Five swatches in order 100 to 900 or Base plus A1 plus A2 plus N plus Contrast
Roles primary secondary accent neutral background
For each role provide hex rgb hsl and relative luminance
Provide recommended text color light or dark and contrast ratio
Provide use guidance one sentence for each role
Provide sample button and heading preview in UI for instant contrast check

ADDITIONAL BRAND STARTERS PER PALETTE:
Typeface suggestions two pairs headline plus body with open source fallbacks. Provide Google Fonts names with weights and import links
Icon style suggestion outline rounded sharp geometric or handcrafted plus example icon pack names when open source
Imagery direction three adjectives plus subject hints for mood board. Example warm sunlit wood grain micro texture
Logo concept prompts three short prompts suitable for a future logo task. Example monogram with hidden leaf motif letter S and G interlock

EXPORTS:
Download a ZIP containing
palette.json the full structured output for the selected palette
tokens.css CSS custom properties under root including light and dark variants
tokens.scss SCSS variables
tailwind.config.snippet.js Tailwind theme extension colors
swatches.svg an SVG strip of labeled swatches
swatches.png a raster strip 2000 by 300 with labels
ase.adobe if feasible or provide GPL palette file gpl
readme.txt instructions and licensing notes

ARCHITECTURE:
Layer 1 UI form plus live preview renderer. No external CDN required other than Google Fonts if selected
Layer 2 Palette Engine pure function generatePalettes input Industry Tone Theme Seed ContextEnabled ContextData output PaletteSet
Layer 3 Validation and Contrast WCAG utilities
Layer 4 Exporter builds ZIP on the fly. Node uses archiver PHP uses ZipArchive
No database required. Persist latest session to local JSON in tmp for convenience

PALETTE ENGINE ALGORITHM OVERVIEW:
Step 1 Industry to Base Hue Set
Use a curated map from industry to a small set of base hue anchors. Example healthcare cool blue green. Construction warm orange yellow plus neutral slate. Finance deep blue navy plus conservative neutrals. Beauty soft pastels or rich jewel tones depending on Tone. Legal navy charcoal burgundy. Restaurant food safe reds greens earth tones segmented by cuisine if available
Step 2 Tone Modifiers
Apply saturation and lightness profiles per Brand Tone. Example premium lower saturation deeper contrast. Playful higher saturation brighter accents. Eco friendly greens plus earth neutrals with lower saturation
Step 3 Theme Preference
Bias background and neutral selection toward light or dark accordingly. Ensure at least one high contrast text pairing on both light and dark backgrounds
Step 4 Harmony Rules
Choose triad analogous complementary or split complementary based on tone and industry defaults. Clamp saturation and lightness to avoid neon or muddy results
Step 5 Accessibility Pass
Compute contrast for role pairs. If a role fails required thresholds iteratively adjust lightness and or choose adjacent hue while keeping harmony type constant. Require AA for normal text and AAA for UI controls when feasible. Guarantee at least 1 pairing that meets AA 4.5 1 for body text and 3.0 1 for large text
Step 6 Determinism
If Seed provided use seeded RNG to decide among equally valid choices so the same inputs produce the same palettes. Provide seedBack in output

UI FLOW:
Screen 1 Input Form left column. Live Preview right column
User enters Industry and optional Tone Theme and Seed. Business info fields are visible with clear note internal only does not change output unless toggled
Click Generate. Show three tabs Palette A Palette B Palette C
Each tab shows the five roles as large tiles plus sample components heading body link button card
Buttons Copy CSS Copy SCSS Copy Tailwind JSON Download ZIP
Toggle Dark Preview only affects preview not token values unless Theme Preference set to dark
Accessibility panel shows contrast scores. If any required pairing fails mark red and auto regenerate that role until it passes

SERVER ROUTES OR CONTROLLERS:
POST api generate accepts JSON per schema returns palettes JSON
GET api export zip accepts query paletteIndex and returns ZIP built from the JSON payload and templates
Static serve UI and assets

SEEDING AND RANDOMNESS:
Use Mulberry32 or xorshift seeded RNG for JS. Use mt_srand with seed in PHP
All non deterministic picks must draw from the seeded RNG

FONT SUGGESTION LOGIC:
Map Tone to curated pairs
premium Playfair Display plus Inter or Spectral plus Source Sans 3
modern Inter plus Roboto Slab or Manrope plus Inter
playful Righteous plus Nunito or Baloo 2 plus Mulish
conservative EB Garamond plus Source Sans 3
techie Space Grotesk plus Inter
healthcare Poppins plus Source Sans 3
legal Libre Baskerville plus Work Sans
fallbacks system ui stacks for safety

CONTRAST RULES:
Body text on background must be at least 4.5 1. Large headings 3.0 1. Buttons plus inputs plus badges at least 4.5 1 between text and background. Calculate relative luminance from sRGB with gamma correction

COLORBLIND CHECK:
Simulate protanopia deuteranopia tritanopia. Ensure at least primary versus accent distinction remains visible by adjusting saturation and lightness if deltaE below threshold

ERROR HANDLING:
If industry not recognized pick closest match by fuzzy lookup. If tone invalid default to trustworthy. If palette generation fails after three constraint passes return safe neutral blue based fallback with accessible pairings and message

PERFORMANCE:
Generation must complete under 50 ms per palette on a 2 vCPU VPS. ZIP export under 300 ms for typical payloads

TEST CASES ACCEPTANCE:
Given Industry healthcare Tone conservative Theme light Seed 42 expect deterministic hex sets across runs
Given Use Context Off business fields filled. Output must be identical to empty fields
Given Theme dark ensure background is dark neutral and textOn for primary and accent resolves to light with AA contrast
Given random seed 0 still deterministic
Given Industry legal return at least one deep navy driven primary

CLI SCRIPT OPTIONAL:
node scripts generate demo or php artisan command to generate sample outputs for snapshot tests

LICENSE AND ATTRIBUTION:
Use only open source fonts. Include OFL text when bundling. All outputs are original token data generated by algorithm

SECURITY:
No persistence of client business details by default. If you add persistence wrap in a .env flag

FUTURE ROADMAP NOT REQUIRED FOR MVP:
Logo concept draft via procedural SVG monogram. Export full brand sheet PDF. Industry tuned imagery sampler. Admin editor for industry to hue map

DONE CRITERIA:
Form collects inputs. Palette Engine returns three accessible palettes. Exports produce ZIP with tokens and swatches. Deterministic seeds. Basic tests pass
