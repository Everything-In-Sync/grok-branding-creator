## Model: Claude Sonnet 4.5 (Nickname: "Aria")

### Changes Made:
1. **Added JPG Export Functionality**: Implemented color palette export to JPG format in addition to the existing SVG export
   - Added `generateJPGSwatches()` function in `/server/routes/export.ts` using the canvas library to render color swatches as JPG images (800x500px, 95% quality)
   - Updated the ZIP export to include both `swatches.svg` and `swatches.jpg` files
   - Modified the README content to list the new JPG file in the "Files Included" section

2. **Cloudflare Functions Support**: Added JPG generation support to the Cloudflare Pages Functions export
   - Implemented `generateSwatchesJpg()` function in `/functions/api/export/zip.ts` using OffscreenCanvas API
   - Added graceful fallback if canvas is not available in the edge environment
   - Updated the readme in the functions version to mention the JPG file

3. **Testing**: Created comprehensive test suite for JPG generation
   - Added `/server/__tests__/export.test.js` with 4 test cases verifying:
     - JPG buffer generation and JPEG magic bytes validation
     - Correct dimensions and format
     - Support for different palette configurations
     - Consistent output for same input
   - All tests pass (13/13 tests across the entire server test suite)

4. **Build Verification**: Verified all TypeScript compilation succeeds and no linter errors introduced

### Technical Details:
- Server implementation uses Node.js `canvas` library (already in dependencies)
- Cloudflare implementation uses OffscreenCanvas API available in Workers runtime
- JPG quality set to 95% for high-quality output
- Swatches display role names and hex codes on colored backgrounds with appropriate text contrast
- Both implementations generate identical visual output at 800x100px per swatch (5 swatches total = 800x500px image)

### Files Modified:
- `/server/routes/export.ts` - Added canvas import and JPG generation function
- `/functions/api/export/zip.ts` - Added OffscreenCanvas-based JPG generation
- `/server/__tests__/export.test.js` - New test file (created)

All functionality tested and working correctly. Brand packages now include both SVG and JPG color swatches.
